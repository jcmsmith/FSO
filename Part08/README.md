### Library App

In this project, we developed a GraphQL application for a small library, starting with [a base](https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/misc/blob/master/library-backend.js). We had to implement a database, user administration, many routes for retrieving information from queries, and a frontend to go along with it all.
