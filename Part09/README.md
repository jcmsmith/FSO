# Part 9 - TypeScript

I'll be honest, I was initially excited to try it but this part didn't end up leaving me with the best first impression of TypeScript. I'll use it if I have to, of course, but at least for now I think I'm sticking with JS for my own needs!

## Core Concepts

- Background, pros and cons of using TS
- Basic TS syntax, built-in and Utility Types
- Interfaces and type unions for more complex types
- tsconfig
- Avoiding the Any, Undefined types with type guards and validator functions
