# Part 6 - State management with Redux

This part was complicated, and I managed to smash through it quite quickly!

## Core Concepts

- Action creators, reducers, and the state store
- Redux hooks, Redux Toolkit, mapDispatchToProps, and connected components
- Pure functions
- Array spread syntax

## Projects

### Unicafe Redux

A simplified version of the [Unicafe project](https://github.com/jcmsmith/Full-Stack-open/tree/main/part1/unicafe) from part 1, using Redux for state management.

### Anecdotes-redux

A modified version of the [Anecdotes app](https://github.com/jcmsmith/Full-Stack-open/tree/main/part1/anecdotes) from part 1, also using Redux for state managment but with a more complex configuration.
