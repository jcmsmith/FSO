### CourseInfo

A static HTML page - the very beginnings of learning to manipulate the DOM using React (And the first time I ever wrote any JavaScript!).

### Unicafe

This project taught me about buttons, event handlers, HTML tables, state management, and how to refactor React components. The end result is a simple application that collects feedback and displays a list of the given ratings.

### Anecdotes

The concepts from the material and previous exercises put together into a page that allows for voting on anecdotes, and displays the most popular anecdote along with an "anecdote of the day".
