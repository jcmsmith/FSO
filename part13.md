## Notes

Prior to this part, I wasn't extremely familiar with SQL and relational databases so it took a while for me to wrap my head around establishing the correct relationships between different tables. Partway through it clicked, I realized I was overcomplicating the connections, and I was then able to refactor and simplify the models and breeze through the rest of the course!
