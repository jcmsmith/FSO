## Projects

### Routed Anecdotes

A refactoring of the original [Anecdote app](https://github.com/jcmsmith/Full-Stack-open/tree/main/part1/anecdotes) to use in-app navigation via React Router.

### Country Hook

A small refactoring of the [Countrydata app](https://github.com/jcmsmith/Full-Stack-open/tree/main/Part2/countrydata), the same core concept but now using a custom useCountry hook to fetch data and update the React state.

### Ultimate Hooks

From a [starting point](https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/ultimate-hooks), we were tasked with extracting the logic for fetching data into its own generic useResource hook.

### Bloglist Extended

The first version of the Bloglist app in which both parts are in one project, with the frontend completely redesigned to use Redux and React Router. We now have multiple different views, blog comments, a navigation toolbar, and styles using Material UI!
