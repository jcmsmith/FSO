---

## Projects

### Calculators

A couple of simple calculators designed for a first introduction to TS, one for BMI and one for exercise goals

### Courseinfo

Another version of the [CourseInfo project](https://github.com/jcmsmith/Full-Stack-open/tree/main/part1/courseinfo), but now in TypeScript!

### Patientor

The frontend was [provided for us](https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/patientor), and we were challenged to construct a backend that works with it. The end result is a mock internal service for a doctor's office, allowing the user to access patient information and assign diagnosis codes and notes about visits, etc.

## Notes

I'll be honest, I was initially excited to try TypeScript but this part didn't end up leaving me with the best first impression of it! I'll use it if I have to, of course, but at least for now I think I'm sticking with JS for my own needs.

## Total hours: 27
